# Lab Report 4: "Done Quick" Lab
## Step 1: Setup
To delete the forked repository from my ieng6 account, I typed `rm -rf lab7` in the terminal, then hit `<enter>`. I did so in the VSCode terminal after ssh-ing in. The following screenshot shows the command in the terminal, as well as the contents of my ieng6 directory before and after deleting the forked lab7 repository.

I also deleted the forked repository from my Github account. I went into the forked repository, went to settings, scrolled to the bottom, and clicked "Delete this repository," as shown below.

## Step 2: Forking
To fork the repository, I clicked on the "Fork" button once in the repository.

## Step 3: Start the Timer
Start the timer on your phone to time the next steps. 
## Step 4: ssh
Log into your ieng6 account using ssh. To do this, I typed <ssh cs15lwi23asa@ieng6.ucsd.edu> into my VSCode terminal and hit `<enter>`.

I was never prompted for my password because I saved my public ssh key in my ieng6 account. 
## Step 5: Cloning
To clone the forked repository from my Github account, I first clicked on the "Code" button under the repository. Next, I copied the HTTPS link, as shown below.

Once I had the link copied, I went back to the VSCode terminal. I typed `git clone` then hit the buttons `<command>+<v>` to paste the link after. Next, I hit `<enter>`. The terminal command and output should look like the following.
