# Lab Report 4: "Done Quick" Lab
## Step 1: Setup
To delete the forked repository from my ieng6 account, I used the terminal command `rm -rf lab7` to delete the directory and its contents. I did so in the VSCode terminal after ssh-ing in. The following screenshot shows the command in the terminal, as well as the contents of my ieng6 directory before and after deleting the forked lab7 repository.

I also deleted the forked repository from my Github account. I went into the forked repository, went to settings, scrolled to the bottom, and clicked "Delete this repository," as shown below.
